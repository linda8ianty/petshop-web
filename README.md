# petshop-web
my backend-frontend portfolio using PHP native and SQL for database connection. Online demo at https://petshop-web.herokuapp.com
Due to issue in my MySQL Workbench so it can't do CRUD automatically in CMS page online demo. But you can execute it at localhost.

For the first time (if you access the online demo at Heroku), you can enter CMS by:

Username: petshop
Password: petshop
